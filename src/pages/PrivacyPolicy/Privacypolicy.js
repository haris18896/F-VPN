              <p>
                This document <b>(“Privacy Policy”)</b> explains what information we collect, what we don't collect, and how we
                collect, use, and store information. We do not collect logs of your activity including browsing history, incoming
                and outgoing traffic, the data you access, or DNS queries. We also never store sensitive connection logs
                permanently, meaning no logs of your IP address, assigned VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session
                duration. We assert that we only collect minimal data, the sole purpose of which is to operate our VPN and keep it
                running smoothly. We designed our system to not keep any sensitive/personally identifiable information. This
                ensures that we have no data to share even when required by the law
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 id='list-item-2'>General Information</h2>
              <p>FriendsVPN collects three types of information</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Personal Information</li>

                <p>
                  This is the information we collect for managing FriendsVPN user subscriptions. This includes name, email
                  address, and payment information which is collected when a user subscribes to our premium plans
                </p>

                <li>VPN Connection Summary Statistics</li>

                <p>
                  FriendsVPN collects minimal information about the usage temporarily in order to operate the system and to
                  maintain outstanding customer support and quality of service. The section below specifies what data we collect.
                  These statistics never include anything related to the user activity or tracking
                </p>

                <li>Anonymous App Diagnostics</li>

                <p>
                  FriendsVPN collects app diagnostic data, which includes crash reports, usability diagnostics, and VPN connection
                  diagnostics. These statistics are anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual FriendsVPN users. This helps
                  us to identify the bugs and the issues faced by users to maintain the quality of service
                </p>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 id='list-item-3'>Personal Information</h2>
              <p>
                FriendsVPN collects personal information when you sign up and purchase the subscription either through a website
                or mobile. We collect names, email addresses, and payment details in order to create an account. The payment
                information depends on the payment method and payment processors (i.e. Stripe, Ayden) used by us. In the case of
                credit/debit card payment, this information includes cardholder name, card number, card expiry date, and CVC.
                FriendsVPN offers various subscription plans having specific time periods. Once you purchase the subscription, you
                can use the premium services. At the end of the subscription period, your subscription will automatically be
                renewed and your chosen payment method will be charged unless you decide to cancel your subscription before its
                expiry. If you cancel the subscription before its expiry, your subscription will not be renewed and will be
                expired at the end of the subscription period. It will also be expired in case if the system failed to perform a
                successful transaction using your payment method at the end of the subscription period. When a subscription is
                expired, your payment information is deleted from our system. You have to provide new payment details if you want
                to re-subscribe after expiry.
              </p>
              <p>FriendsVPN uses your email address for the following reasons:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>To send emails related to the account (signup, logins)</li>

                <li>To send emails related to payment transactions</li>

                <li>To provide links for resetting passwords</li>

                <li>To send you updates and announcements</li>

                <li>
                  To send marketing campaigns, offers, and surveys, etc. You can opt-out if you do not want to receive marketing
                  emails
                </li>

              <h2>Anonymous App Diagnostics</h2>
              <p>
                FriendsVPN collects anonymized app diagnostic data, which includes crash reports, application monitoring,
                usability diagnostics, and VPN connection diagnostics. We use this data to identify problems and areas for
                improvement in our apps, servers, and other services. The information we receive is fully anonymized and cannot be
                tied back to individual FriendsVPN users.
              </p>

              <p>We collect the following anonymized information:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Diagnostic information about if and how a VPN connection attempt failed.</li>

                <li>
                  App monitoring, diagnostics, and error tracing. These are handled in an anonymized form by these third parties
                  depending upon the platform user is using
                  <br /> <br />
                  <ul>

              <h2 id='list-item-4'>VPN Connection Summary Statistics</h2>
              <p>FriendsVPN never collects the browsing history, incoming and outgoing traffic, DNS Queries. Therefore:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service</li>
                <li>We do not know the data or content a user accessed during the VPN connection</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                But FriendsVPN collects some stats for just the current session (i.e. when a user is connected to VPN). As soon as
                the user is disconnected, the session is terminated and logs are wiped out. These stats are below
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>User IP Address</li>
                <li>User Country</li>
                <li>User ISP</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                These stats are required to track the number of concurrent VPN connections for each user and to properly
                investigate and fix user connection issues and service disruption in various regions. When a user disconnects the
                VPN. these logs are automatically removed. We do not share these temporary logs with anyone and ultimately these
                logs are wiped out from the system when the session ends
                <br />
                <br />
                We have designed our systems to categorically eliminate the storage of any sensitive data wherever it exists. We
                are committed to our user's privacy by not possessing any data related to online activities.

              <p>
                FriendsVPN core mission is to keep your information hidden and secure. We are not obliged to store user data. And
                even if we receive a legal order, we have no worthwhile data to share with any law enforcement agency from any
                particular country in the world. This ensures the privacy of our users.

              <h2>Storing of Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Support Tickets</h2>
              <p>
                FriendsVPN keeps records of queries, complaints, or compliments you submit to us through our Website or Services,
                along with our response. Depending on how you contact FriendsVPN, we may collect your email address and any
                additional information you provide to us. Having full correspondence records enables our staff to provide the best
                possible customer support experience. We might use different third-party platforms for support correspondence:
                Zendesk for emails and support tickets etc. When you contact us using these platforms, they will store your
                correspondence records including your email address, as well as user and device attributes that help with
                troubleshooting. These platforms utilize modern security practices and the best encryption.

              <h2 id='list-item-7'>Security Measures to Protect Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                FriendsVPN stores the passwords, public keys, and private keys and any sensitive data securely using strong
                cryptographic algorithms where necessary.
                <br /> <br />
                Pertinent security measures are taken in place for the protection of this information against unauthorized access,
                unauthorized alteration, destruction, or disclosure of data. Access to user information is restricted to staff who
                require such access to perform their respective duties. Access Control Procedures are properly managed and
                monitored. The staff who require specialized access are bound by confidentiality obligations. They may be
                subjected to disciplinary action, which includes termination and criminal prosecution, upon failing to meet these
                obligations.
                <br /> <br />
                Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices. None of these data centers require us to
                collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN Services. If any data center
                were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative
                options. Even if any of our servers are seized or attacked to break its encryption, there is no information that
                would tie up an individual user to a particular behavior, service, or website
                <br /> <br />
                While we affirm that we have put every possible effort to make this system robust and secure. it is important to
                understand that no data security measures in the world can be declared 100% foolproof.
