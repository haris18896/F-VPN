              <h2 id='list-item-3'>Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>
                FriendsVPN is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history, ingoing or outgoing traffic,
                data content, or DNS queries from users connected to our VPN. During user signup, we collect some sensitive
                information, such as your name, email address, and payment information. We only collect minimal information that
                is necessary to operate our Services.
                <br />
                <br /> For the sake of clarity and transparency, we have placed all information related to data collection in a
                separate document known as the Privacy Policy, which is available on our website. Please review our&nbsp;
                <a href='/privacy-policy' className={clasess.link__styling}>
                  Privacy Policy&nbsp;
                </a>
                in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your sensitive data
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 id='list-item-4'>Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
              <p>
                Our paid Services are subscribed on a subscription period basis. Subscription purchases are handled via multiple
                third-party payment companies. You choose the subscription period and the payment method yourself when you sign up
                for the paid services. Once you purchase the subscription, you can use the premium services. At the end of the
                subscription expiry, your subscription will automatically be renewed and your chosen payment method will be
                charged unless you decide to cancel your subscription before its expiry. FriendsVPN reserves the right to amend
                subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the website or email.
                Any changes to the fees will not affect the subscriber's current subscription period and will become effective
                upon subscription renewal. If you update payment details in your account, the updated information will be
                considered for any future payments. If you cancel the subscription before its expiry, your subscription will not
                be renewed and will be expired at the end of the subscription period. It will also be expired in case if the
                system failed to perform a successful transaction using your payment method at the end of the subscription. When a
                subscription is expired, your payment information is deleted from our system. You have to provide new payment
                details if you want to re-subscribe after expiry. <br />
                <br />
                Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license to use on six (6) different devices at any given time. If you
                want to use the services on more than six devices at a time, then you have to purchase another subscription plan
                using the new account.

            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 id='list-item-5'>Refund Policy</h2>
              <p>
                FriendsVPN does not grant refunds for subscription payments. The reason for not offering any money-back guarantee
                is that we may offer a trial on the first subscription. We do not charge any payment if we offer a trial. The
                trial period may vary from 1-7 days. Once the trial ends, we charge a payment fee according to the subscribed
                plan. So we expect the user must rely on the trial period to properly evaluate our service.

            </div>

            <div>

                FriendsVPN reserves the right to investigate matters we consider to be violations of these Terms. We may, but are
                not obligated to, in our sole discretion and without notice, remove, block, filter, or restrict by any means any
                materials or information that we consider to be actual or potential violations of the restrictions set forth in
                these Terms, and any other activities that may subject FriendsVPN or our user to liability. FriendsVPN disclaims
                any and all liability for any failure on our part to prevent such materials or information from being transmitted
                over the Service and/or into your computing device.
